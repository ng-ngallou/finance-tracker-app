Python app for my personal card transactions. It analyzes my monthly transactions to my personal categories and plots a pie plot. It also prints out unclassified transactions.
I pay both in EUR and CHF, so I built a web scraper, which will pull the monthly average value and convert CHF pyments to the equivalent EUR value.

Use the file dummy_data.csv for demonstration.
